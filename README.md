## Prerequisites

- Docker (https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
- Docker Compose v1 or v2 (https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)
- A valid Steam account with DayZ purchased
- Sufficient disk space for DayZ server files (~12GB per server)

## Installation

1. Download the latest FerruZ release for your platform from the [Releases page](https://github.com/tristanpoland/ferruz/releases).

2. Make the binary executable:
   ```bash
   chmod +x ferruz
   ```

3. Move it to a directory in your PATH:
   ```bash
   sudo mv ferruz /usr/local/bin/
   ```

## Quick Start

### Configure Steam Credentials

Before deploying a server, you'll need to configure your Steam credentials:

```bash
ferruz config
```

### Deploy Your First Server

Interactive mode (recommended):

```bash
ferruz deploy
```

Or with specific parameters:

```bash
ferruz deploy --name my-server --port 2302 --max-players 60 --location chernarusplus
```

### Start, Stop and Restart Servers

```bash
# Start a server
ferruz start my-server

# Stop a server
ferruz stop my-server

# Restart a server
ferruz restart my-server
```

### List All Servers

```bash
ferruz list
```

### View Server Logs

```bash
# Show the last 100 lines of logs
ferruz logs my-server

# Follow logs in real-time
ferruz logs my-server --follow
```

## Server Management Commands

### View Server Status

```bash
ferruz status my-server
```

### Update Server

```bash
# Update server
ferruz update my-server

# Update with file validation (fix corrupted files)
ferruz update my-server --validate
```

### Manage Mods

```bash
# List installed mods
ferruz mods list my-server

# Add mods (using Steam Workshop IDs)
ferruz mods add my-server 1559212036,1590841260

# Remove mods
ferruz mods remove my-server 1559212036

# Update all installed mods
ferruz mods update my-server
```

### Access Server Shell

```bash
ferruz shell my-server
```

### Execute Commands

```bash
ferruz execute my-server ls -la
```

### Backup and Restore

```bash
# Create a backup
ferruz backup my-server

# Create a backup with custom output directory
ferruz backup my-server --output /path/to/backup/dir

# Restore a backup
ferruz restore my-server /path/to/backup/file.tar.gz
```

## Advanced Configuration

### Server Configuration Files

Server config files are stored in the server data directory:
```
~/.local/share/ferruz/servers/data/dayz-server-[NAME]/
```

The main configuration file is `serverDZ.cfg`. Edit this file to customize server settings beyond what's available through the CLI.

### Custom Server Config

You can provide a custom server configuration when deploying:

```bash
ferruz deploy --name my-server --config /path/to/custom/serverDZ.cfg
```

## Data Storage

FerruZ stores its configuration and server data in the following locations:

- **Config file**: `~/.local/share/ferruz/config.json`
- **Server files**: `~/.local/share/ferruz/servers/data/dayz-server-[NAME]/`
- **Backups**: `~/.local/share/ferruz/backups/`

## Tips for Server Operators

1. **Server Performance**: The DayZ server can be resource-intensive. Allocate sufficient CPU cores and RAM for optimal performance.

2. **First Start**: The initial server startup may take some time as it downloads DayZ server files from Steam.

3. **Port Forwarding**: To make your server publicly accessible, forward the following ports in your router:
   - Server Port (Default: 2302/UDP)
   - Port+1 to Port+4 (2303-2306/UDP)
   - Port+14714 (27016/UDP)

4. **Regular Backups**: Set up regular backups of your server to prevent data loss.

5. **Workshop Mods**: When adding mods, ensure they are compatible with each other.

## Troubleshooting

### Server Won't Start
- Check if Docker service is running
- Ensure you have enough disk space
- Verify port availability (ports might be in use by another service)
- Check the logs with `ferruz logs [server-name]` for detailed error messages

### Poor Server Performance
- Check CPU and memory usage with `ferruz status [server-name]`
- Consider reducing the number of mods or players
- Ensure your host system has adequate resources

### Connection Issues
- Verify port forwarding configuration in your router
- Check firewall settings
- Test connectivity with tools like netcat
